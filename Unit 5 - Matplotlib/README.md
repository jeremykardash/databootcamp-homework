Observations of Pymacueticals:
1) Capomulin and Ramicane had significantly lower final tumour volumes on average than Infubinol and Ceftamin.
2) The capomulin treatment shows a steady decline in tumour size over the 45 day period as illustrated in the figure labelled "capomulin treatment of mouse s185."
3) There is a strong relationship between the average size of a tumour and the average mouse weight. The correlation bewteen mouse weight and average tumor volume is 0.8419.
